# SmartTab - Tame your tabs with AI

## 💡 Inspiration
The inspiration for SmartTab came from a universal problem faced by modern internet users: tab overload. As someone who regularly conducts research online, I noticed a pattern - people open dozens of tabs, trying to maintain complex mental maps of how information connects. The existing solutions only organize tabs by domain or manually created groups, missing the deeper context of how these pages relate to each other.

What if we could leverage AI to understand not just what tabs are open, but why they're open and how they relate to each other?

- Automatically detects research patterns and learning sequences
